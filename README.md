# QModernWidgets
Currently a WIP repo of some more modern looking QtWidgets as I learn QT. Initial prototyping was written in PySide6 and then transfered to C++.
 Currently only a QSwitch and isn't entirely finished yet (have some ideas for it if I can figure it out, like drop shadows on the knob/background). For example the stylesheets dont change the values of the colors yet. Mainly is uploaded currently to get some feedback on the code while I work on it.

Switch design is heavily inspired by the IOS Switch element.

Current Switch WIP:
